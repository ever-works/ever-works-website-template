-- Forward migration template for future improvements
-- This migration can be used to address any issues found in historical migrations
-- without modifying the original migration files

-- Example: Add any missing indexes or constraints here
-- Example: Fix any data inconsistencies here
-- Example: Add any missing columns or defaults here

-- This file serves as a template for future forward migrations
-- that need to be applied after the historical migrations

-- No changes needed at this time - migration history is clean
